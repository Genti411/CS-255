Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Being that the driver pass has observed a scarcity of resources designed to assist individuals in successfully passing their drivin¬¬¬¬¬g tests. As a result, they have expressed interest in collaborating with us to develop a website-based platform. This platform will offer students access to online practice exams and the convenience of scheduling on-road training sessions.

What did you do particularly well?
Making the Procces easy and simple 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I would chose to reivese Comunnication tools specificly make it more mobile friendly through sms.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approchate by getting a bird eye view first. Undestanding and comperhanding of whats needed as a whole from the project,.

Project 1

Requirements
	Below we determined that functional requirements specify the actions the system needs to perform, nonfunctional requirements dictate the manner in which the system must execute those actions, assumptions set the prerequisites for the system's effectiveness, and limitations delineate the restrictions or parameters affecting the system's configuration and functionality.

Project 2

Technical Requirements
Functional Requirement	Rationale for Requirement
User Authentication	Required for maintaining data security and privacy 
Course Management 	Required so creators and instructors create, organize and update course content 
Assessment and Grading	Required for creating and designing assignments and exams. Helping automate grading and tracking of progression
Analytics and Reporting	Required to gather data of student performance, and course effectiveness
Communication Tools 	Required for proper communication through messaging systems and discussion boards.
Integration with External Systems 	Required for best user experience, integrated with other systems to enhance accessibility and efficiency


Nonfunctional Requirement	Rationale for Requirement
Scalability	Required to handle a high number of users and content without destroying the user experience or performance 
Usability and Accessibility	Required to be accessible to people with special needs and user friendly 
Security and Data Privacy	Required to have encryption and authentication policies to keep information private while applying with regulations
Reliability and Availability	Required to accommodate different schedules from different groups 
Performance	Required for a great system performance to have the best learning experience.
Interoperability	Required to be able in being used across different platforms and browsers.
